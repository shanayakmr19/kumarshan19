We had loads of compliments given to us by our guests of how lovely Lora played and the ambience she provided. We highly recommend Lora! It really was prefect, and such a nice personal touch to have someone playing an instrument over a playlist !!"</p>

Lora played some background music at our wedding and everyone loved it. I would absolutely recommend having Lora play at any event. She was very professional and the music was absolutely amazing."</p>

                    <p>"Lora recently performed at my wife’s 50th birthday party which was held in the Begonia House in Botanical Garden. Her music created a beautiful ambience and was widely appreciated by those attending. Her musicianship and dedication to her craft shine through her playing, her calm presence let’s her guitar take center stage. She puts herself aside to let the music come through, and this allows a fluid, committed and emotionally evocative performance. Her range covers classical, Spanish and popular pop music. I would highly recommend her for any event."</p>
